# myF1Project
This project was created to make an automated graph, using Python, specifically Pyplot and BeautifulSoup, that shows the distance margins in the top 3 finishers in an F1 race to scale. It automatically pulls information from the F1 website using BeautifulSoup and then
plots appropriate data using Pyplot.
